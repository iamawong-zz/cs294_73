This was for a graduate computer science course aimed towards computational sciences. The website can be found here: www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~colella/CS294_73F2011/.

We were taught the different motifs of Computational Sciences
1. Structured Grids
2. Unstructured Grids
3. Fast Fourier Transforms
4. Sparse Linear Algebra
5. Dense Linear Algebra
6. Particle Methods

In this repo is the homework that we did and the final project where we attempted to reproduce a paper by Dr. Phillip Colella.
